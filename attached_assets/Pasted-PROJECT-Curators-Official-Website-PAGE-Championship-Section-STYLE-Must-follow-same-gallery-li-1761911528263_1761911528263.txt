BRAND CONTEXT FOR AGENT UNDERSTANDING  

Curators is a creative movement uniting digital editors and storytellers.  
The Short Editing Championship is our annual flagship event celebrating the power of editing and youth creativity.  
Tone must remain inspiring, noble, and artistic — less like a competition, more like a modern renaissance of editing.  

----------------------------------------------------
GOAL  

The page must make the visitor feel the weight and glory of creation — like standing inside a gallery where each video frame is a masterpiece.  
It should inspire editors to register and brands to collaborate instantly.
