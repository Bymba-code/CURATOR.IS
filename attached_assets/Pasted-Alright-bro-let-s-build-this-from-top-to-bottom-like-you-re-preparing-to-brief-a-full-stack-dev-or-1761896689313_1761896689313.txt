Alright bro — let’s build this from top to bottom like you’re preparing to brief a full-stack dev or AI agent to code the entire Curators website system, not just a landing page.
We’ll go section by section to decide menus, info structure, and content goals.


---

🧭 1. Main Navigation Menu (Hamburger + Header)

Your top bar should make visitors instantly understand:
“This is a creative movement + professional hub for editors.”

Main Menus:

1. Home — cinematic landing page
Purpose: set emotion & vision (what Curators is)


2. About — your story, mission, and philosophy
Include: “We dream our paint…” quote, “Edit mind, not video” ethos, founding story, movement purpose


3. Championship — the Short Editing Championship page
Include: details, registration link, rules, past champions, video highlights


4. Community — all about your Discord & members
Include: membership tiers, benefits, culture, testimonials


5. Store — monetization hub
Include: merch, editor packs, tools, subscription plan links


6. Events — upcoming meetups, past event galleries, sponsor recap


7. Partners — sponsor brands, collaborations, funders, supporters


8. Join Us / Login — CTA for both new and returning members

🏛️ 2. Core Website Sections (Home Page Scroll Layout)

Every section connects art + digital craft.

Full-screen parallax panel with van Gogh quote:
“We dream our paint and we paint our dream.”

Overlay subtle light like a gallery spotlight.
