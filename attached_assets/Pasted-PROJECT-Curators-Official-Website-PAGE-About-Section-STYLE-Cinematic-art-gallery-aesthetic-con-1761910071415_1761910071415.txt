Paragraph 1:
“Curators began as a small creative circle that believed editing is more than cutting videos — it’s the art of shaping how people see the world.  
Today, we are a growing community of 2,500 creators united under one vision: to turn creativity into discipline, and discipline into legacy.”

Paragraph 2:
“Our mission is to empower creators to discover the artist within — not through tools, but through mindset.  
We unite editors, designers, and storytellers to build a new creative culture where art, technology, and purpose merge.”

🧠 INTERACTION LOGIC

• When user clicks “About” from hamburger menu, smooth-scroll transition from homepage to this section.  
• Use fade-in/fade-out animation for background photo and text.  
• Maintain same motion language as home page: slow, elegant, cinematic feel.  
• Keep total load light and optimized (CSS-only transitions, no heavy JS).  
• Ensure visual continuity — color palette and fonts must match home section perfectly.
